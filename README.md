# DarkForest
In this 3D project, the artificial intelligence of enemies was implemented, as well as the ability to make saves and unload them. Enemies are able to attack the main character and also calmly move around the map until they notice the main character. Also in the project, a raycast is implemented thanks to which the player can shoot at opponents.
